                        sent to OPM, but we do not collect personal information for any purpose other
                        than to respond to you. We collect personally identifiable information (name,
                        email address, Social Security number, or other unique identifier) only if

                        give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency,
                        or as otherwise required by law. Moreover, we do not create individual profiles
                        with the information you provide or give it to any private organizations. We do
                        not collect information for commercial marketing.

                    <p>
                        We ensure that our website remains available to all users by using a Government

                        identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise
                        cause damage.
